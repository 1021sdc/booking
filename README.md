## Deploying

This module is using docker-compose for deployment.

You should check the './db/index.js' file before deploying(change the host)!

And don't forget to build 'bundle.js' with webpack on production mode using the command below.
```sh
npm run build
```

In './booking' directory, there is a dockerFile for building the image of database

When you try to deploy, run
```sh
docker-compose up
```
from the root directory, and push those images to your docker hub.

In your instance, make another docker-compose.yml file with vim.
```sh
vim docker-compose.yml
```

Copy this docker-compose.yml file and change 'build' script to 'image' and change directory to the name of the images.

// before you run any files, please run this script
